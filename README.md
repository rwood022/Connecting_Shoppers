## Description
I was motivated to create this project to understand how to create a back-end database with connecting routes.
As new web developer, I wanted to showcase my knowledge of back-end production.
Many people are begining to create start up business, most E-Commerce start -ups. With this application I now have a understanding of how to create a website that could be used for small business start-ups.
I learned how to seed a database using Sequelize and MySQL. Ilearned how to create GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE routes. I learned how to use Insomnia to check the route connects without a front-end.

## Installation
To install the application the user would need to open my application with VSC and use Insomnia to view the GET, POST, PUT, DELETE routes.

## Usage
A user could use this application as a create a full-stack application.

## Credits
